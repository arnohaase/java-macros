* SmartString
  * restrict to string *literal* as a parameter
  * (create and) use expression parsing abstraction
  * error handling, warn / error / info messages
  * source position handling

* special tests
  * test several macro methods in one class
  * test macro method in nested class

* remove explicit annotation processor from maven build

* samples / poc
  * method macros
    * log.debug(...) --> if(log.isDebug()) ...
    * SmartAssert
    * log method invocation with all parameter names (!) and values
  * class macros
    * @ImmutableStruct

* get macros to work with Eclipse compiler
* IDE integration

notes
-----
* macro methods:
  * implementation: first parameter 'CompilerContext', other parameters wrapped 'JCExpression'
  * return type 'JCExpression'

  * how to get the compiler to process files in the 'right' order?! Does that happen automatically based on dependencies (if there are no cycles)?
    * require macros to be pre-compiled, i.e. on the class path?

  * method macros: generate synthetic method with 'callable' signature (n-1 params) --> satisfy IDE tooling
    * initially: 'Object' as type for all parameters
    * later: analyze generic signature of 'Tree' param of the actual parameter

  * configurable phase of application

  * 'CompilerContext' type as first parameter
    * factory for AST nodes
    * emit warnings and errors
    * convenience: support for parsing and entering of new code (--> Scala macros)
    * Symtab
    * TreeMaker

  * TreeMaker

* documentation
  * Name: efficient string storage
  * Symbol
    * Type Hierarchy
    * iniatialized in phase 'Enter'
      * ClassSymbols are eagerly initialized in Enter itself
      * for members (methods in particular), symbols are lazily initialized
        * --> symbols (MethodSymbol in particular) have a field 'completer'
        * if not-null, the completer is called once lazily and then set to null
        * only implementation is MemberEnter
      * MethodSymbol is initialized in MemberEnter.memberEnter (protected visibility)
  * Type
  * Scope
    * byte code is generated only for members contained in a class' scope
  * Env
  * Resolve: 'helper class for name resolution', i.e. <whatever> to Symbol
  * Name: always *simple* name - fully qualified names are an AST of their own!

  * creating a synthetic method for a class that has just passed Enter phase
    * create an AST for the body
    * make.MethodDef (variant without method symbol!)
    * prepend to the defs of the owning JCClassDecl
    * get the class' environment by calling enter.getEnv(owner.sym)  // TODO possible optimization by setting flags in enter before the call?
    * call memberEnter.memberEnter(methodTree, env) --> use reflection because that does not have public visibility

  * Xyz.instance(context) is meant to allow replacing some component with a modified version / subclass
    * only works before JavaCompiler is instantiated
    * --> i.e. in a separate Main method
    * neither from compiler plugins nor from annotation processors

  * javac: -XD is the 'back door' to the compiler's options --> -XDx=y
    * javac -verbose
    * javac -XDverboseCompilePolicy=true

  * maven build for annotation processor
    * META-INF/services/...Processor should be included in JAR but must not be present during compilation (bootstrapping problem)
    * add <proc>none</proc> to the compiler plugin configuration

  * inserting methods: flag 'SYNTHETIC' apparently hides a method from being called explicitly from code

  * type names in Java code are represented by 'expression' trees
    * JCIdent for simple names
    * JCFieldAccess for prefixed packages

  * creating a null literal:         make.Literal(TypeTag.BOT, null);

* samples
  * SmartString
